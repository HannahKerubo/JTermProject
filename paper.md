This page shows an analysis of the growth of Gross Regional Product between all 47 of Kenya's counties between the years of 2016-2017.

## Background

In order to obtain my data, I took the data set of DOSE (Global dataset of reported subnational economic output) and filed out only the data of Kenyan counties' gross rate production in the local currency unit(shillings) in 2016 and 2017. Using this selected data I was able to analyze the change in grp in each county within a year.

## Graph 

![](#GRPchart)

Looking at the graph we can see that every county experienced growth. Counties like **Nakuru** and **Kiambu** seem to have the largest amount of growth visually.

## Table

![](#GRPtable)
This table shows the first 5 rows of the data I analyzed. It shows the county, GRP in shillings, and the year to data was taken from. You can view the full table `here`.

## Equation

$ (\text{Value in 2017 column}) - (\text{Value in 2016 column}) = \text{Growth (in GRP) that a county had in a year} $

## Conclusion

Analyzing information like this allows the tracking of the growth and decay of GRP in different counties in a country, further allowing us to compare which counties are doing better than others. We can then further use this data to determine what component of a county causes the higher growth in one county compared to others. Using this same logic on a larger scale the whole `DOSE report` can be used to compare different countries as a whole.
