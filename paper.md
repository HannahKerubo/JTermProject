This page shows an analysis of the growth of Gross Regional Product between all 47 of Kenya's counties between the years of 2016-2017.

## Background

In order to obtain my data, I took the data set of DOSE (Global dataset of reported subnational economic output) and filed out only the data of Kenyan counties' gross rate production in the local currency unit(shillings) in 2016 and 2017. Using this selected data I was able to analyze the change in grp in each county within a year.

## Graph 

![](#GRPchart)

Looking at the graph we can see that every county experienced growth. Counties like **Nakuru** and **Kiambu** seem to have the largest amount of growth visually.

## Table

![](#GRPtable)

## Equation

$ (/text{Value in 2017 colum}) - (/text{Value in 2016 colum}) = /text{Growth (in GRP) that a county had in a year} $

To d [`myst-spec`](https://spec.myst.tools), that aims to capture this information and transform it between many different formats, like PDF, Word, JSON, and JATS XML (Figure 4). This specification is arrived at through a community-centric MyST Enhancement Proposal ([MEP](https://compass.executablebooks.org/en/latest/meps.html)) process.



## Conclusion

There are many opportunities to improve open-science communication, to make it more interactive, accessible, more reproducible, and both produce and use structured data throughout the research-writing process. The `mystjs` ecosystem of tools is designed with structured data at its core. We would love if you gave it a try -- learn to get started at <https://myst.tools>.
